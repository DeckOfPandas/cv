%	PERSONAL STATEMENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Personal Statement}
I am passionate about technological products that address real-world user needs without over-engineering, or compromising on ingenuity or quality.
I thrive in the space between the client and the wider technical team, where I enjoy finding evidence-based ways to balance client needs against overall product direction, technical considerations or constraints, and sustainability.
I am organised and quick yet fastidious.
My broad background helps me understand different types of challenges and different types of people.
I believe in Open, good science, and common sense.\par
\medskip
I want to work as part of a collaborative team alongside engaged, curious people, and learn from seasoned colleagues.
